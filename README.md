# Purrfect Pet Finder

An App using the petfinder API so users can search for adoptable pets in their area. With the search, the user will receive a training video for the animal selected.

## Motivation

As an owner of two pets that have been adopted. I wanted to make an easy search that would also help users train their new pet.
